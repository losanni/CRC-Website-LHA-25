        <h2 id="prekickoff">Pre-Kickoff</h2>
        <li id="pre1">
          We set up and tested our basic robot with last year‚Äôs parts. We made
          the decision to adopt a tank movement style after some challenges we
          faced with last year‚Äôs system. New, grippier, rubber wheels were also
          added, in exchange for last year‚Äôs harder wheels.
        </li>
        <li id="pre2">
          On the side, to keep the robot team busy and introduce the new members
          to the team and equipment, we made progress on a go-kart.
        </li>
        <h2 id="november">November</h2>
        <li id="nov1">
          Construction started on the arm and game pieces replicas.
        </li>
        <li id="nov2">We opted to use VEX parts for the robot arm.</li>
        <li id="nov3">
          We experimented with servos (which last year‚Äôs team could NOT figure
          out how to use ü´µ).
        </li>
        <li id="nov4">
          We built an arm for the robot, but are redoing it because the first
          one was too tiny, so a new one was made / ordered / modified?
        </li>
        <li id="nov5">
          1st we made a small mock arm from a tutorial to test the feasibility
          of doing an arm.
        </li>
        <li id="nov6">
          We also 3D modelled another robot design (Adrian‚Äôs concept).
        </li>
        <h2 id="december">December</h2>
        <li id="dec1">We continued building the arm system.</li>
        <li id="dec2">
          To lift/raise the system, we used a power motor (MODEL) and attached a
          string from the arm to the motor shaft. The preliminary tests worked
          well, so we made improvements by adding edges to the shaft to create
          what is, more or less, similar to a winch.
        </li>
        <li id="dec3">
          We ran small tests on the motors on the arm by directly powering them
          from a 5V source to see if they could support the weight, and for the
          most part, everything worked. We only needed to add a second motor in
          the middle.
        </li>
        <h2 id="bw">Before Winter Break</h2>
        <li id="bw1">We finished building the arm.</li>
        <li id="bw2">Created a new compartment for the robot.</li>
        <h2 id="ob">Over Winter Break</h2>
        <li id="ob1">
          We really procrastinated on this one, but finally, the robot's
          circuitry was adjusted to meet this year‚Äôs requirements and new
          components.
        </li>
        <li id="ob2">
          I moved the Arduino and light onto the C, and the fuse box plus
          everything else onto the P. The fuse box is our ‚Äúpower distribution‚Äù
          wiring for the robot.
        </li>
        <h2 id="january">January</h2>
        <li id="jan1">
          With arm construction finished, we started the wiring and programming.
        </li>
        <li id="jan2">
          We plugged our 2-wire 393 and 263 motors into the Arduino. At first,
          we were confused as to why we couldn‚Äôt control them properly‚Äîit seemed
          like they were always getting power. The problem was, we thought they
          acted like servos, but the 2-wire motors needed motor controllers to
          function correctly. We used the 2-to-3 wire VEX Motor Controller 29,
          since we had a bunch lying around, and began testing the arm one motor
          at a time. <strong>FIRST DAY BACK:</strong> To wire it, we started by
          removing the tips from the 3-cable wires we had. We soon realized this
          was taking too much time and damaging our wires, forcing us to
          reconnect them using wire caps. So we adopted longer 2-cable wires
          since that‚Äôs all we needed.
