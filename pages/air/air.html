          The main hero and peacemakers of the video. They spent most of the
          sessions running around the school taking pictures and recording
          videos, so they had a busy schedule. This year, in keeping with the
          theme, they decided to make a parody of Avatar The Last Air Bender ™️
          with some easter eggs to help engage the audience and be the main
          character of the video. They also worked on the journal for the
          website.

          In january, we started making the Tutorial. We decided to make the
          tutorial on servo motors because it was we didn't undertand how to use
          at first. Everyone else was using it, but we didn't know how to. We
          learned most of our stuff through trial and error, the WIKI, and
          random videos online. The last part of the tutorial, were most of the
          coding happened was inspired by a YouTuber named FireShip.IO. His
          programming videos have a unique style we wanted to replicate.
