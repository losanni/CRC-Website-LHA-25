          The main hero and peacemakers of the video. They spent most of the
          sessions running around the school taking pictures and recording
          videos, so they had a busy schedule. This year, in keeping with the
          theme, they decided to make a parody of Avatar The Last Air Bender ™️
          with some easter eggs to help engage the audience and be the main
          character of the video. They also worked on the journal for the
          website.
