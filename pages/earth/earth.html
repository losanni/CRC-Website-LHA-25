          We started familiarizing the programmers with the programming part of
          the competition. For the beginners, we started teaching Python. With
          the more advanced, we showed them old CRC programming competition
          problems.

          For returning members, we discussed some new ideas for the website.

          We are finally starting to code / talk about the website more
          technically.

          We had made very minimal progress on the website to date, blame the
          captain üôà, so we had to catch-up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Last year, we synchronized the website progress by using Github, and
          we‚Äôre doing that again this year. We again used it to keep code up to
          date across machines, but we wanted to take advantage of more of the
          available features. Early on, we set up a sort of ‚Äòplan‚Äô using the
          ‚ÄòProjects‚Äô feature and kept track of progress with it. It seemed like
          the best way to organise progress on the website in one relevant
          place. SCREENSHOTS
        </li>
        <li>
          We made progress on the website. Starting with the map. The idea was
          to have a map as our primary navigation. We considered two options. A)
          Create a static image and overlay invisible links. Or B) Build it from
          scratch. We chose B. Of course, it seems harder at first, but when we
          realized the image would end up being resized and have elements that
          grow in hover, we might as well just build it from the ground up.
          Rory, our lead artist, recreated a map from avatar. She drew the map
          as a whole and then exported the individual elements. Through trial
          and error, we manually positioned the elements on top of the complete
          map to get the position correct, modifying the ‚Äòtop‚Äô and ‚Äòleft‚Äô
          attributes. Honestly, it didn‚Äôt take that long surprisingly. After
          that, we adjusted the Z-index to make it work properly and rebuilt the
          map with the correct background and edge. SCREENSHOT

          One of the core aspects of Avatar‚Äôs plot is Ang‚Äôs mastering of the
          elements. We wanted that somewhere on the website. Our interpretation
          was, as you visit the different teams‚Äô pages, essentially mastering
          each different element, you become closer to becoming the avatar. We
          made a progress tracker with each element‚Äôs icon on the bottom right
          of the screen, keeping track of progress with‚ÄòsessionStorage‚Äô, which
          is by default grey, and becomes coloured when you master that element.

          One fundamental thing to make sure worked before we started filling
          our website with content was the translation logic. We took
          inspiration from last year where the text content was stored in
          different json files. We then read it from there then applied it to
          the right element‚Äôs innerText. However, we made big changes.
          <ul>
            <li>
              We split the translation files based on the individual webpages,
              rather than having all content in one large json file. For
              example, we made a ‚ÄúCRC-Fr.json‚Äù instead of using a universal
              ‚Äúfr.json‚Äù. This seemed more intuitive to us.
            </li>
            <li>
              We made the code universal, aka not hardcoding anything (in the
              sense of french translation), including the urls and the elements
              into the individual page‚Äôs scripts. The code reads the element ids
              from the json file and modifies accordingly. The same logic works
              for all webpages.
            </li>
            <li>
              We didn‚Äôt rewrite english translations, instead we opted to
              refresh the page, since the majority of content was in english to
              begin with. This has no effect on the visible content, the code
              detects the language and changes it
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <h2 id="january">January</h2>
        <li>
          We created a top navigation bar that is present on all pages. It
          includes a link back to the home page, where all the navigation is,
          and the translation buttons, which change depending on your current
          language, showing you only the necessary one.
        </li>
        <li>
          We made adjustments to certain pages to make them more functional on
          mobile devices. In many cases, we made elements stack on top of each
          other instead of be placed next to each other
